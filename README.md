# Real-Time-Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-and-Route-Optimization-for-London

## Objective: 
Build a system that predicts real-time traffic congestion in London and provides optimized routes to reduce travel time. This project will simulate a real-world TfL challenge and demonstrate your ability to handle data, build models, and deliver actionable insights.
