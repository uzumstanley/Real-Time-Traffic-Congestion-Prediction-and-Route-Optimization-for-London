# Real Time Traffic Congestion Prediction and Route Optimization for London

## Objective: 
Build a system that predicts real-time traffic congestion in London and provides optimized routes to reduce travel time. This project will simulate a real-world TfL challenge and demonstrate my ability to handle data, build models, and deliver actionable insights.

## Project Framework

1. Problem Statement

What: Predict traffic congestion in real-time and optimize routes for drivers.
Why: Congestion is a major issue in London, costing time, money, and increasing emissions. TfL is actively working on solutions like smart routing and traffic management.
How: Use TfLâ€™s open data to build a predictive model and integrate it with a route optimization algorithm.

2. Data Sources

All data is open-source:

TfL Unified API:
Provides real-time traffic flow, speed, and congestion data.
TfL API Documentation (https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/api-details#api=ReleasedUnifiedAPIProd&operation=StopPoint_Get)

OpenStreetMap (OSM):
Road network data for London (nodes, edges, and traffic rules).
Use the osmnx Python library to extract and visualize road networks.

Historical Weather Data:
Weather impacts traffic (e.g., rain increases congestion).
Use free APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
Event Data:
Public events (e.g., concerts, football matches) affect traffic.
Scrape event data from websites like Eventbrite or use APIs.


3. Tools & Libraries

All tools are free and open-source:

Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation.
scikit-learn, tensorflow/pytorch: Machine learning models.
osmnx, networkx: Road network analysis and visualization.
folium, matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization.
flask: Build a simple web app for user interaction.
requests: Fetch data from APIs.
