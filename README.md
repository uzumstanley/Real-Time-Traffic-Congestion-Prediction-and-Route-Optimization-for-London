# Real-Time-Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-and-Route-Optimization-for-London

## Objective: 
Build a system that predicts real-time traffic congestion in London and provides optimized routes to reduce travel time. This project will simulate a real-world TfL challenge and demonstrate your ability to handle data, build models, and deliver actionable insights.

## Project Framework

1. Problem Statement

What: Predict traffic congestion in real-time and optimize routes for drivers.
Why: Congestion is a major issue in London, costing time, money, and increasing emissions. TfL is actively working on solutions like smart routing and traffic management.
How: Use TfLâ€™s open data to build a predictive model and integrate it with a route optimization algorithm.

2. Data Sources

All data is free and open-source:

TfL Unified API:
Provides real-time traffic flow, speed, and congestion data.
TfL API Documentation

OpenStreetMap (OSM):
Road network data for London (nodes, edges, and traffic rules).
Use the osmnx Python library to extract and visualize road networks.

Historical Weather Data:
Weather impacts traffic (e.g., rain increases congestion).
Use free APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
Event Data:
Public events (e.g., concerts, football matches) affect traffic.
Scrape event data from websites like Eventbrite or use APIs.
