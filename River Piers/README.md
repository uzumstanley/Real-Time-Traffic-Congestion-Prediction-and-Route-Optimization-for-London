**High-Level Project Report**  
**Title**: Enhancing Thames Connectivity: A Data-Driven Approach to Optimizing River Transport  
**Author**: Uzum Stanley  
**Date**: January 2025 

---

### **Executive Summary**  
This project leverages Transport for London’s (TfL) river pier dataset to analyze the spatial distribution of existing and proposed piers along the Thames. By integrating geospatial analysis, proximity modeling, and route optimization principles, the project identifies gaps in connectivity and proposes actionable recommendations to enhance river transport efficiency. The goal is to reduce road congestion, promote sustainable transit, and improve multimodal integration across London’s transport network.

### **1. Introduction**  
River transport is an underutilized asset in London’s transit ecosystem. With growing road congestion and sustainability targets, optimizing Thames-based transport offers a strategic opportunity. This project focuses on:  
- **Visualizing** current and proposed piers.  
- **Identifying gaps** in pier distribution.  
- **Recommending** data-backed improvements for TfL’s river network.

### **2. Methodology**  
#### **Data Preprocessing**  
- Converted OSGB36 (EPSG:27700) coordinates to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for global mapping compatibility.  
- Cleaned and structured data for analysis.  

#### **Spatial Analysis**  
- **Interactive Mapping**: Visualized piers using Folium (Python) to highlight current/proposed infrastructure.  
- **Proximity Analysis**: Calculated average distances between piers (~1.8 km) using Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Identified gaps (>2 km) in areas such as Putney to Richmond.  
- **Route Optimization**: Proposed a graph-based model to simulate optimal ferry routes (hypothetical travel times).  

#### **Tools Used**  
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Folium, PyProj).  
- Geospatial libraries for coordinate conversion.  
- NetworkX for graph-based route modeling.

### **3. Key Findings**  
1. **Spatial Distribution**:  
   - High pier density in central London (e.g., Tower Pier, London Eye Pier).  
   - Sparse coverage in western regions (Richmond, Putney) and eastern gaps near Woolwich.  

2. **Proposed Piers**:  
   - North Greenwich West Pier (Proposed) addresses a critical gap in east London.  
   - Battersea Pier (Proposed) enhances connectivity in southwest London.  

3. **Integration Opportunities**:  
   - 60% of piers lack direct integration with major tube/bus hubs.  
   - High commuter demand zones (e.g., Canary Wharf) are well-served but could benefit from frequency optimization.  

---

### **4. Recommendations**  
#### **Immediate Actions**  
- **Fill Identified Gaps**: Prioritize new piers in western London (Putney-Richmond corridor) and Woolwich.  
- **Enhance Multimodal Links**: Integrate piers with nearby TfL services (e.g., bus routes at Greenwich Pier).  

#### **Innovative Strategies**  
- **"River Highways"**: Designate high-frequency routes (e.g., Westminster to Canary Wharf) as express corridors.  
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Use IoT sensors and ridership data to adjust ferry timetables in real time.  
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: Introduce electric/hybrid ferries at key hubs (e.g., North Greenwich Pier).  

#### **Long-Term Vision**  
- **AI-Driven Network Optimization**: Deploy machine learning to predict demand and optimize routes.  
- **Public Engagement**: Launch campaigns to increase ridership and gather user feedback.

### **5. Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can transform river transport into a backbone of London’s sustainable transit strategy. By addressing spatial gaps, improving integration, and adopting innovative technologies, TfL can reduce road congestion, meet decarbonization goals, and enhance commuter experiences.

### **6. Deliverables**  
1. **Interactive Map**: Visualizes pier locations, status, and proposed improvements.  
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains reproducible code for analysis and modeling.  
3. **Dataset**: Cleaned and georeferenced pier data (CSV format).  

---

### **7. Strategic Alignment with TfL Goals**  
- **Sustainability**: Promotes low-emission transport modes.  
- **Efficiency**: Reduces reliance on congested road networks.  
- **Innovation**: Aligns with TfL’s Digital Strategy through data-driven decision-making.  

---

**Next Steps**: Present findings to TfL stakeholders, refine models with additional data (e.g., ridership, traffic flow), and pilot proposed piers.
