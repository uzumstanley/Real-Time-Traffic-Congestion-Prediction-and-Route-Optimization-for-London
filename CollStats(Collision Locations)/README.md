Project Overview

Collision Analysis and Prediction System using the TfL dataset. The goal is to analyze historical collision data, identify patterns, and build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of collisions in specific areas. This system can help TfL improve road safety by identifying high-risk zones and implementing preventive measures.


Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to understand the types of collisions, locations, severity, and contributing factors (e.g., weather, road type, time of day).
Visualization: Create visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in the data.
Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of collisions based on features like location, time, weather, and road conditions.
Innovation: Propose actionable insights for TfL to reduce collisions, such as targeted road safety campaigns, improved lighting, or traffic management.


Tech Stack Python and Tools/Libraries:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Data Source: The dataset is TfL Collision Statistics Data.
